Deep Learning -  - 
 - is a subset of machine learning methods - 
 -  - based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with representation learning
Deep Learning -  - 
 - uses multiple layers in the network - 
 -  - Deep-learning architectures (e.g., deep neural networks, deep belief networks, etc.)
Deep Learning -  - 
 - can be either supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised - 
 -  - various applications (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc.)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) -  - 
 - were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems - 
 -  - have various differences from biological brains (e.g., static and symbolic vs. dynamic and analog)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) -  - 
 - are generally seen as low-quality models for brain function -
